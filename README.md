# HW Week 2 day 1: JS Objects


### Exercice: The Movie Database

It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

- Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
- Print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
- Maybe the [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) method will be helpful here
